# S.M.A.R.T. Prompt Framework for GitHub Copilot Coding Agents

**Consumer Complaints ML + GenAI System Edition** - Framework for creating high-quality coding agent instructions aligned with prompt engineering best practices, Machine Learning classification, and Google Gemini explanation integration patterns.

---

## 🎯 **The S.M.A.R.T. Framework**

Use this framework to create highly effective coding agent instructions:

```text
S - Specific Role Definition (Senior Python Developer, Frontend Engineer, AI Integration Specialist, etc.)
M - Mission-Critical Requirements (What must be accomplished with measurable outcomes)
A - Audience-Aware Communication (Team expertise level, architectural maturity, domain context)
R - Response Format Control (Code structure, architecture patterns, documentation style)
T - Task-Oriented Constraints (Technology stack, architectural patterns, forbidden actions)
```

---

## 🏛️ **Consumer Complaints System Alignment**

When creating prompts, consider:

- **Prompt Pattern**: Is this instruction-based, role-based, chain-of-thought, or evaluation?
- **Use Case Context**: What task type (ML classification, text preprocessing, GenAI explanation, model training)?
- **ML/GenAI Integration**: Which integration pattern (Scikit-learn pipeline, Google Gemini Python SDK, prompt engineering)?
- **Template Reusability**: Can this prompt be templated for reuse across similar ML/GenAI use cases?

- ❌ DO NOT modify requirements.txt to downgrade packages
- ❌ DO NOT modify package.json to downgrade dependencies
```

### **File Modification Boundaries:**

```markdown
- ❌ DO NOT modify [specific files]
- ✅ ONLY modify [allowed areas]
```

### **Build Requirements:**

```markdown
When building backend, use: cd src/backend && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
When building frontend, use: cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run build
Ensure all code follows project standards (PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for TypeScript)
```

## ✅ **Effective Instruction Patterns**

### **DO - Be Specific and Explicit:**

- ✅ "Create prompt_engine.py to construct structured prompts for Google Gemini API"
- ✅ "Update EmailGenerator.tsx to handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages"
- ✅ "Fix JWT token validation in auth.py - check token expiration and signature"

### **DON'T - Be Vague:**

- ❌ "Fix the authentication"
- ❌ "Make it work"
- ❌ "Update the code"

## 📝 **Constraint Language Examples**

### **Strong Constraint Language That Works:**

```markdown
🚨 ABSOLUTELY DO NOT modify .env.example or commit API keys to repository.

The following packages MUST remain at their current versions:
- google-generativeai: Latest stable version
- flask-jwt-extended: Latest stable version
- react: ^18.0.0
- typescript: ^5.0.0

CRITICAL: Any attempt to commit API keys or downgrade versions will require task restart.
```

### **Weak Language That Doesn't Work:**

```markdown
Please try to maintain Python 3.9+ compatibility
Prefer keeping current package versions
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Prompt Design Patterns**

### **Multi-Layered Prompt Architecture:**

```markdown
SYSTEM LAYER:
You are a [Specialist Role] with expertise in [Technology Stack] and [Domain Expertise].

CONTEXT LAYER:  
[Project context, current situation, business requirements]

TASK LAYER:
[Specific implementation task with clear deliverables]

SPECIFICATION LAYER:
[Detailed technical requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria]
```

### **Conditional Logic for Complex Scenarios:**

```markdown
LOGIC FRAMEWORK:
IF issue_type == "gemini_api_error":
THEN approach: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
AND include: Proper error handling and user notification

ELIF issue_type == "jwt_authentication":  
THEN approach: Verify token signature and expiration
AND include: Refresh token mechanism

ELIF issue_type == "database_connection":
THEN approach: Check connection string and PostgreSQL service
AND include: Connection pooling and error recovery
```

### **Progressive Refinement Pattern:**

```markdown
BASE PROMPT: [Core role and task definition]

REFINEMENT 1: Add specific technical constraints
REFINEMENT 2: Define output format requirements  
REFINEMENT 3: Include quality standards and acceptance criteria
REFINEMENT 4: Add monitoring and validation requirements

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

### **Agent is working correctly when:**

- ✅ It acknowledges constraints explicitly
- ✅ It asks clarifying questions about boundaries
- ✅ It maintains N-Tier architecture separation
- ✅ It focuses on code changes, not configuration changes
- ✅ It provides detailed progress updates
- ✅ It never commits API keys or secrets

### **Agent needs restart when:**

- ❌ It immediately modifies forbidden files
- ❌ It commits API keys or secrets
- ❌ It ignores explicit constraints
- ❌ It breaks N-Tier architecture separation
- ❌ It takes overly broad approach to simple problems

## 🔄 **Agent Restart Protocol**

### **When to restart the coding agent:**

- Agent commits API keys or secrets
- Agent breaks N-Tier architecture separation
- Agent modifies forbidden files
- Agent ignores explicit constraints
- Agent takes wrong architectural approach

### **How to restart:**

1. Close current pull request
2. Create new pull request with more explicit constraints
3. Include specific examples of what went wrong
4. Add stronger constraint language

## 🏗️ **N-Tier Architecture Patterns**

When tasks span multiple architectural layers, apply these patterns:

### **Pattern: N-Tier Architecture Separation**

```markdown
ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN: N-Tier Architecture with Clear Layer Separation

LAYERS INVOLVED:
- Presentation Layer: React.js with TypeScript (Frontend)

- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure token storage (localStorage with expiration)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based route protection
- Token refresh endpoint
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Input validation and sanitization

QUALITY GATES:
✅ Tokens are properly signed and validated
